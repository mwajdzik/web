## TypeScript

* new language, transpiled to JS
* adds classes, interfaces, modules, generics

## Java

* static typing - type of variable cannot be changed and is known
* strong typing - strongly typed language is more likely to generate an error or refuse to compile if the argument passed to a function does not closely match the expected type
* synchronous
* object oriented programming
* class-based

## Java Script

* dynamic typing (Java Script)
* weak typing (Java Script) - weakly typed language may produce unpredictable results or may perform implicit type conversion
* asynchronous, single-threaded
* functional programming
* prototype-based
